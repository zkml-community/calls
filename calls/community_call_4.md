### Agenda
***Statement***
I don't want this community to die down, we can make this flourish and become a beautiful thing! But we probably need to organize a bit more/give the community a push to have something to get excited about.

Hence, I've come up with some ideas for 2023. Feel free to add to this below :)

- Loose ideas for 2023 in zkml 
    - Survey ppl in the community to find out what we should rally around (common interests, pain points), then come up with a plan
    - Go deeper into one vertical and work closer on this one thing, smaller community but more dedication? (research, development, applications,...)
    - Organize an (1st online) event open to everyone (similar to ZK podcast online events)
    - Do a hackathon
    - Partner up with another ZK/cryptography community and merge with them as we have similar interests
    - ...
- What are the latest breakthroughs in zkml research?
- Can we create a decision tree for which methodology to apply to which problems (FHE, MPC, ZKP, ZKML, etc.)?
